      Javascript is a programming language. It is a scripting language that lets
      us control multimedia within our web pages. It empowers a developer to do
      many things like adding animation to our images or updating content
      automatically on a page.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you are on a web page that has a shopping cart powered by
      JavaScript, you wll notice that it immediately shows the total cost of
      what you want to buy including taxes, shipping, etc. Javascript is then
      used when determining whether the credit card details you entered were
      valid before transferring those details across the net to the bank for
      processing.

      Javascript is now THE language of the web. For years it was only run in
      browsers to operate on HTML. It also runs on servers and is as powerful as
      many of the programming languages you wll encounter.

      JavaScript is among the worlds most used programming languages. Without
      it, well be looking at pages that do nothing other than display images and
      text. So while CSS may be what offers style to a website, JavaScript (JS)
      is what gives it life.

      return number * number;} </code>

    <p>Variable means anything that can vary. In JavaScript, a variable stores the data value that can be changed later on.</p>
    <p>A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable. There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers). Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.</p>
    <code>const PI = 3,14;</code>
    <code>
    //THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR 
    function f() {};
    const f =5;
    //THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO 
    function f()
    {const g= 5;
    var g;
  //statements }
    </code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Scope">
    <header>Scope</header>
    <p>Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript. The two types of scope are local and global: Global variables are those declared outside of a block. Local variables are those declared inside of a block.</p>

    <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
    <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello" + yourName); }
      greetMe("World");  
      </code>

      The name of the function.
      <ul>
      <li>A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
      <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.</li>
      <li>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square</li>
      <li>Function expressions are convenient when passing a function as an argument to another function. The following example shows a map function that should receive a function as first argument and an array as second argument:</li>
      <li>In JavaScript, a function can be defined based on a condition. For example, the following function definition defines myFunc only if num equals 0:</li>
